This presents a unique opportunity to be one of the first experience living in this iconic Edinburgh building.,Located in the popular area of Broughton, the Kingsford Residence on McDonald Road is within easy walking distance of all that the City Centre has to offer; the bars, shops and restaurants of St Andrew Square and George Street (15 minutes), Edinburgh’s Botanical Gardens (10 minutes) and Waverley Train Station (20 minutes) for those travelling further afield. Residents are encouraged to make use of the local cycle paths, public transport and the Enterprise Car Club which operates two spaces immediately outside the building.

These include a spectacular roof terrace with panoramic views across the city, “The Club Room” which functions as an elegantly designed resident lounge with large screen TV, coffee bar and plenty space to relax with friends and fellow residents, “The Bridge” which functions as co-working space and bookable private dining room with fully fitted kitchen to cater for larger gatherings, and “The Gym” which consists of a functional training studio and separate cardio suite which will be available for both private use and trainer led classes.,Residents should be aware that the Residence is immediately adjacent to the Broughton Primary School and as such there will be an inevitable level of noise heard from children playing during their breaks, both during the school day and at afterschool clubs. Residents must be willing to accept that an element of noise from the playground forms part of community life in this location given the proximity of the School.,As this apartment consists of a mezzanine deck level and stairs it is unfortunately unsuitable for small children.,The Kingsford Residence operates a strict no-smoking policy in all apartments and throughout the building.
