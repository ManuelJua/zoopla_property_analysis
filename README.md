# zoopla_property_analysis
This is a web scraper made with Scrapy. This project and all it contains may not follow the website www.zoopla.co.uk policies and it is intended for learning purposes only. Use it at your own risk. I have been running this scraper on zoopla.co.uk for about a month before I was not allowed anymore by the website's robots.txt file. 
I was able to run the spider once a day with a .bat file that executed the scraper commands and Windows Task Scheduler.The geocoding of the properties addresses wwere done with Google Platform's geocoding API.
